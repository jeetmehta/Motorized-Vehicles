As seen above, a majority of responders report themselves in \"Very good\" shape, or \"Good\" shape. There's approximately twice as many people that reported being in \"Excellent\" shape, as opposed to \"Fairly good\" shape. Following this distribution, we can fill out 4/11 values as \"Very good\", 3/11 values as \"Good\", 2 values as \"Excellent\", and one each for \"Fairly good\" and \"Poor\".

       "No one will pay attention to sidewalk speed limits unless there is enforcement I live near a retirement home and many people use these superfast chairs on the road and the sidewalk This should be prohibited especially since the home is next to a school I have nearly been run over by these superfast chairs and the owners give ME a dirty look for not moving out of the way!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    1\n",
       "All devices (high speed wheel chairs e-bikes in-line skates bicycles etc ) must be operated responsibly Individuals must be made responsible for the safety of all Perhaps the City can post Rules of the Road for trails and bike paths and sidewalks--No passing at more than a walking speed; Provide an audible notice of intent to pass (e g  call out Bike on your right when contemplating a pass on the right side of a slower moving individual); Stop and/or move off the trail or sidewalk when meeting an individual with lesser mobility (e g  baby stroller wheelchair walker etc );  The bottom line is that when 2 individuals with highly different speeds collide there will be damage A bicycle hitting a car or a Mack truck will result in more damage than a runner hitting a pedestrian Pedestrians wheelchair passengers and bicyclists have no protective cocoon around them like a motor vehicle passenger Motor vehicles (i e  cars and trucks not bicyles or e-bikes) should not mix with other less massive less protective and less speedy forms of transportation And all forms of transportation sharing a common thoroughfare must be courteous and responsible for everyone's safety I am nearly 65 years old I used to ride a 10 speed bicycle about 10 km to work but I can't make it up some of the hills now Fortunately the Province of Ontario had the foresight to allow something called an e-bike to be used like a bicycle and I can now ride my e-bike to work using the electric assist on hills I can't negotiate under my own steam I ride on a few sidestreets with very little traffic on the Waterfront Trail through unofficial trails in fields and occassionally on sidewalks rather than busy 4-lane roads I am careful to slow down and move off the trail whenever I encounter another individual I have never had any sort of problem meeting a pedestrian baby stroller other cyclist etc The only times I have witnessed a problem is when one individual is travelling at high speed overtaking another with no regard for the safety of others It has nothing to do with the mode of transportation it is a problem of a lack of responsiblity and respect for others in a specific individual Perhaps better education at home in school and through posted Rules of the Road would help change this bad behaviour        1\n",
