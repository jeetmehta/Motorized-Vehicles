# Data Science Challenge - Motorized Vehicles

## Problem
Based on E-Bike Survey Response Results also available in CSV Format data available from TO Open Data, train a model to predict whether the survey responder, answers “No - I do not have access to a private motorized vehicle” to the question “Does your household have access to any of the following types of private motorized vehicles?”.

## Analysis

The analysis presented in the notebook will answer the following questions:

- Which models did you consider? Which Model did you choose and why? How good was it?
- What was the pattern of missing values? Was it random? Could those be inferred from the context?
- Which features were significant in predicting the target response?
- If you could re-design the survey for next year, what question(s) would you add or remove in order to improve the precision of the prediction?

## Tools

In terms of software tools utilized, they are:
- Jupyter Notebook (where the code + analysis resides)
- NumPy
- SciPy
- Scikit-Learn
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Table of Contents Extension

### Optional: Table of Contents
To install the Jupyter Table of Contents Extension (not necessary to view the code, it'll just make it easier to navigate the Notebook), follow the steps below:

    $ jupyter nbextension install --user https://rawgithub.com/minrk/ipython_extensions/master/nbextensions/toc.js
    $ curl -L https://rawgithub.com/minrk/ipython_extensions/master/nbextensions/toc.css > $(jupyter --data-dir)/nbextensions/toc.css
    $ jupyter nbextension enable toc

The above installation instructions are from: https://github.com/minrk/ipython_extensions 

### Running the Notebook

Viewing/running the notebook is as simple as:

    jupyter notebook

Navigate to the directory where the file is saved, and simply launch it!

## Conclusion

I really enjoyed going through this problem! I'm excited to get feedback on my work here, learn how about how I can contribute towards the work at Shopify! Thanks so much for the opportunity!
