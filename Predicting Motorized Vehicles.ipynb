    "Dealing with the missing values can be done in the same manner as done so far, by following the given distribution in the data (since the number of missing values is pretty small, only 11). As seen above, a majority of responders report themselves in \"Very good\" shape, or \"Good\" shape. There's approximately twice as many people that reported being in \"Excellent\" shape, as opposed to \"Fairly good\" shape. Following this distribution, we can fill out 4/11 values as \"Very good\", 3/11 values as \"Good\", 2 values as \"Excellent\", and one each for \"Fairly good\" and \"Poor\".

    "2. Income (This makes a lot of sense - people with greater incomes can afford to buy/access a motorized vehicle)\n",
    "3. Education/Employment (are these correlated with income?)\n",

    "I'm guessing that the above 5 factors will largely play a role in determining whether a household has access to a motorized vehicle. The other features (pertaining to e-bikes and regulations) seem less directly relevant, although a case could be made for the \"Collisions experienced\" category (indicating whether they've experienced a collision involving a motorized vehicle on the multi-use trails).\n",

    "#### Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "There's a few things to note here:\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, there's a visible skew (as mentioned earlier) in the dataset with regards to the gender of responders. Responders are primarily male, whereas the number of females who have answered the survey is less than half the number of males. Even less it the number of responders who identified with the \"Other/Unspecified\" gender category, amounting to only 10-12 people.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite this skew, it's also clear that a slight trend does exist in the data. Males seem to be more likely to have household access to motorized vehicles in comparison to females or other genders. There's a distinct decreasing likelihood of having access to motorized vehicles as you go from Male -> Female -> Other/Unspecified.\n",
    "\n",
    "This relationship may be void/insignificant considering that the input dataset is skewed, or it may point to basic gender stereotypes that still persist in society today. Food for thought!"

    "#### Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to the previous category, we can note two important things here:\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset contains an overwhelming amount of responders who have greater than 100K (5) household incomes. In contrast, the percentage of people who responded with annual incomes of 20K or less (0) is much smaller. This points to a similar skew as to the Gender category, and perhaps points to a need to **rebalance the dataset** for more accuarate results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Having noted this, our initial hypothesis also seems correct. The likelihood of having access to a motorized vehicle definitely increases as the household income of the responder increases. This makes intuitive sense, and is validated by the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "An interesting thing to check out is whether Education/Employment have the same effect. And if they do, are Education/Employment correlated highly enough with Income such that they can be removed? Let's check it out!"

    "### Education & Employment\n",
    "\n",
    "Like I said above, it'll be interesting to see if education and employment correlate positively with access to motorized vehicles (intuitively, one would think that they do). Also, if education levels, employment and income are all correlated heavily with each other, we can remove certain features and still maintain model accuracy (while reducing risk of overfitting)!"

    "Clearly, from the above figures there is a huge majority of responders living in the Central Toronto / East York districts (the Downtown Core). This heavily skews our dataset, since a bulk of those responders likely don't need to commute very far, and thus have access to a motorized vehicle.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is seen in the second plot, where generally *all* other districts (the remaining 3 inside of Toronto + outside) have a **consistently high likelihood** of having access to a motorized vehicle. Responders living in Central Toronto have a slightly smaller likelihood of accessing motorized vehicles, which makes sense."

    "#### Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Interestingly enough, although the dataset is primarily comprised of people aged between 18 to 49, the subset of younger responders (17 years or younger) almost *all have access to motorized vehicles*. This seems really odd/unintuitive (since 16 is the minimum legal driving age, it seems strange that there are responders within that small age group that have such high access to motorized vehicles).\n",
    "\n",
    "This can be explained by a few things:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Students -> University and Senior high school students in the area may have consistent access to their own / parents' motorized vehicles\n",
    "\n",
    "2. E-Bikes/Smaller motorized vehicles -> tend to resonate with a younger audience. The increasing trend in motorized e-bikes and electric longboards and other motorized vehicles amongst younger people may be reflected in this data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. There may be some outliers (that would need to be filtered), which are skewing the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Barring the surprising high access that the younger age range has, the trend for the remaining data follows common sense / intuition (older responders are likely more independent, and thus have greater household access to motorized vehicles)."

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Before I discuss the above questions, let's summarize all the assumptions made during the process of analyzing this dataset. They have been mentioned during the analysis, but the complete list has been summarized below:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Motorized Vehicles:** Car sharing / car rental is a NO (doesn't count as *private* vehicle)\n",
    "2. **Motorized Vehicles:** Everyone who complained about a lack of multiple options - YES\n",
    "3. **Physical Health:** Disabled -> Poor -> Fairly Good -> Good -> Very Good -> Excellent\n",
    "4. **Physical Health:** Disabled/Injured/Illness/Health Impairment category\n",
    "5. **Gender:** Other/Unspecified category\n",
    "6. **Education:** Highest level attained\n",
    "7. **Education:** college degree (not university and not a diploma) -> classified as “University degree”\n",
    "8. **Education:** Assuming that responders that have put \"some university/uni\" are graduates from that university\n",
    "9. **Employment:** Responses like 'None of your business' = unemployed\n",
    "10. **Employment:** Assuming casual/seasonal employees are still full-time (based on Google search of Employment Rules/Categories)\n",
    "11. **Preferred Transportation:** Winter transportation option acts as default (for seasonal entries)\n",
    "12. Groupings for check-list based questions done on the basis that if they answered a \"No for all categories\", then none of their other responses are considered. Edge cases for these questions have been defaulted to a \"No\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Models\n",
    "\n",
    "**Which models did you consider?**\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned earlier, since this problem is a supervised learning, classification problem we can chose our model from a given subspace. Increasing in complexity, they are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Logistic Regression\n",
    "2. Decision Trees\n",
    "3. Random Forests (Ensemble Decision Trees)\n",
    "4. SVM (Support Vector Machines)\n",
    "5. Neural Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "An important principle is Occam's Razor, which essentially stresses the importance of the simpler solutions. In the case of models, a simpler model has fewer hyperparameters, is less prone to overfitting and generally is more interpretable. Thus, from this subspace of models, I decided to evaluate the performance of a basic Logistic Regression model, and then increase model complexity if necessary!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Which model did you choose and why?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Although some of the reasoning is explained above, Logistic Regression is also particularly well suited for categorical classification (like this case). It's essentially standard linear regression, applied to the logistic function (thereby bounding the output between 0 and 1).\n",

    "1. Hyperapameters are simple and easy to tune (regularization strength and thresholds)\n",
    "2. Can output probabilities or hard 1s/0s (probability/likelihood of a \"No\" is exactly what we want)\n",
    "3. Model is easy to implement, and interpret (can easily view the coeffecient values)\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the format of the model (as well as it's easy implementation in sklearn), along with the reasons mentioned above made it an ideal first choice!\n",
    "\n",
    "**How good was it?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the performance of the models has been evaluated extensively in the analysis portion of the **Modelling & Evaluation** section. However, a quick summary is that the although the model performed relatively well with regards to the overall dataset, it does significantly worse on the negative/\"No\" target class in comparison to the positive/\"Yes\" counterpart.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the dataset is heavily skewed in terms of the people that responded (primarily educated, high-income Males), the resulting classification is also skewed. To compensate for an imabalanced dataset, evaluation metrics were also changed, utilizing metrics like Area Under the Precision Recall Curve (AUPRC) and F1 score (as opposed to traditional mean squared error). In order to avoid this, the dataset should be **resampled (undersampled) ** to provide a more accurate model. This will be covered in the Recomendations & Conclusion section below.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Missing Values\n",
    "\n",
    "**What was the pattern of missing values? Was it random? Could those be inferred from the context?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Missing values in the dataset tended to occur quite frequently, however there was a pattern that seemed to exist amongst the categories that included missing values. These categories generally related to the **most personal information** (things like Sex, Income, Education, Employment, Residence), which makes sense beacuse there must be responders who are hesitant (for privacy or security concerns) to give away such information via an online survey. \n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that the later categories (which had to with e-bike regulation knowledge, Multi-use trails) generally did not have *any missing values* (for the same reason, there is no concern of privacy/secutity giving away your opinion on e-bikes).\n",
    "\n",
    "There were also common indices/specific sample points that seemed problematic/with the most missing values. Details on how they were inferred are covered specifically during the Data Cleaning segment of this notebook, but essentially the method comprised of two approaches:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. When a clear majority/skew in the distribution of that category exists, and the number of missing values is small, assume that the missing values equal the majority value. This approach minimizes the change that the missing value has on the dataset, and therefore minimizes any error that comes with a potentially incorrect assumption.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. When there are a large number of missing values, utilze other categories as context. For example, this was done during the Employment category where Education was used as a prime contextual filtering category. Mimicing the income distribution that specific education levels carried (i.e. \"post graduate\" tended to have predominantly 100K+ salalries), I was able to essentially follow the distribution and minimze any erroneous impact.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Significant Features\n",
    "\n",
    "**Which features were significant in predicting the target response?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Through a combination of Exploratory Data Analysis (Correlation Matrix) and the Feature Importance Matrix provided by the Random Forest Classifier, we've been able to confidently identify a few features that are extremely significant in predicting the target class. These matrices can be seen in their respective sections, along with their related analyses, however a short summary is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Using both the Cross-Correlation matrix and Feature Importance Matrix as guidelines, the top 3 most significant features are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Household Income\n",
    "2. Preferred Mode of Transportation\n",
    "3. Commute Length/Distance\n",
    "\n",
    "Conceptually, this also makes sense. Household income dictates affordability of a motorized vehicle, the preferred mode of transportation (especially considering that it was commonly dependent on weather) dictates user preference, and the commute length contributes to the necessity of a motorized vehicle (as opposed to walking or cycling). It's important to note that even the most significant features had relatively weak correlations with the target class, implying that much can be done to improve the survey questions (if an increase in prediction accuracy is the goal).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Survey Re-Design\n",
    "\n",
    "**If you could re-design the survey for next year, what question(s) would you add or remove in order to improve the precision of the prediction?**\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of increasing the precision of the prediction, we're particularly interested in improving the prediction precision pertaining to the negative target class.\n",
    "\n",
    "There were quite a few changes that can help increase the performance of the final classification. This includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Removing Questions:** Primarily those that relate to regulation, awareness and e-bikes. Not directly relevant to whether the responder has access to a motorized vehicle or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. \"Toronto Bylaws consider personal mobility devices (such as electric wheel chairs) to be pedestrians In your opinion should the City\"\n",
    "2. \"With regards to illegal use of bicycles and e-bikes on sidewalks should the City\"\n",
    "3. \"Currently any kind of e-bike may use a bicycle lane if they are propelled by pedaling only and those propelled by motor power may be fined\"\n",
    "4. \"Currently any kind of e-bike may use a multi-use path if they are propelled by pedaling only and those propelled by motor power may be fined\"\n",
    "5. \"Are you aware that the Multi-Use Paths have a speed limit of 20 km/h?\"\n",
    "6. \"Do you support any of the following statements?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Improving Existing Questions:** Better use of options, formatting etc. can allow for a greater quality of information (and less data cleaning)\n",
    "1. Household has Access to Motorized Vehicle: Provide the ability to check multiple options (checkbox, not radio buttons). Also include AutoShare/Cars2Go and other ride sharing/car sharing/rental services as options\n",
    "2. Gender: Provide an Other/Unspecified category\n",
    "3. Physical Health: Provide a Disabled/Injured category\n",
    "4. Education: Be specific in the question (either provide a \"Student\" category, or go with the commonly used \"Highest level attained\" question). Provide professional certifications as an option.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Adding New Questions**: These are a few questions that I think may have a greater correlation with the necessity/access to a motorized vehicles\n",
    "1. Are you married? Relationship Status\n",
    "2. Do you have any dependents?\n",
    "3. House Type (Appartment, Home, Studio etc.)\n",
    "4. Work in Toronto?\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that the above questions focus quite a bit on the personal details of the responder. Conceptually, it makes sense that people who are married, and have dependents likely need/access a motorized vehicle more than the average single person. Similar correlations may be detected via home type and the location of their work. Note that these are current estimates for questions, and have not been verified emperically."

    "### Reccomendations\n",
    "Although this has been covered previously in this analysis, having completed the entire DS process the two largest shortcomings/reccomendations I can point to are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Improving the Survey (covered above)\n",
    "2. Resampling the Data to improve model performance\n",
    "\n",
    "The former has been elaborated upon in detail above.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that the survey responses collected heavily skew towards full-time working, educated, high-income males that have access to motorized vehicles. This imbalance impacts the resulting model classification, since the model begins to \"learn\" exaggerated positively correlated relationships. The solution to this problem would be to **resample** the dataset (and in this case, it means undersampling the classes that are present in abundance). Thus, it would be necessary to filter out some of the samples that correspond to this majority (full-time working, educated male) and thereby balance out the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using this balanced, resampled version should yield a drastic improvement in the model's performance!\n",
    "\n",
    "Other, minor reccomendations include removing duplication in the code by abstracting certain pieces to their own functions (it was kept since the notebook serves more as a demonstration rather than an actual production codebase) and increase the amount of time spent during hyperparameter tuning. Having access to the original survey would also help add more context during the cleaning process!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "I really enjoyed going through this problem! Having gotten the chance to work with real data and responses, and then go through the entire Clean -> Explore -> Model -> Analyse Data Science pipeline was a fascinating experience. The variability in responses was immense, and the experience of dealing with that variability is impossible to gain through a side project or tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm excited to get feedback on my work here, and learn how I can do better + leverage similar skills to help companies like Shopify! Thanks so much for the opportunity!"
